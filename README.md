# GP-SFH
--------

Gaussian process (GP) based implementation for galaxy star formation histories (SFHs) with custom kernels.

Based on work in Speagle & Iyer et al. (2021; in prep).

Getting started:
- initializing the GP-SFH class
- generating mock SFHs with a predefined kernels
- generating spectra, SEDs and other observables
- adding custom kernels

Documentation on usage and basic tutorials can also be found in the /tutorials folder.
